# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Performing a stock analysis of several companies and comparing them based on rate of return.

## Results

The results of the analysis are that in 2017 all of the companies returned a profit except "TERP". The year 2018 only two companies yielded a profit and they were "ENPH" and "RUN".

The refactored code for the years 2017 and 2018 ran roughly at .67 seconds each, while the original code for the referenced years above ran at roughly 1.9 seconds.

## Summary

One of the advantages of refactoring code is that you have  a template to start with you and the code may be more readable but the con may be it is more time consuming to refactor the code.

The advantage of refactoring the "VB" script was that I only had to figure out the "for loops" all of the formatting for the worksheet existed. However, a disadvantage was when new code was inserted it resulted in numerous code breaks. This resulted in a more research then if an analyst just codes from scratch.
