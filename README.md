# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Performing a stock analysis of several companies and comparing them based on rate of return.

## Results

The results of the analysis are that in 2017 only three out of the 11 "tickers" returned a profit. They were "AY", "ENPH", and "RUN". The tickers "ENPH" and "RUN" both had a return greater than 80%. In addition, they were the only companies that had a return and their numbers are the exact same as last year.

The refactored code for the years 2017 and 2018 ran roughly at .67 seconds each, while the original code for the referenced years above ran at roughly 1.9 seconds.

## Summary

One of the advantages of refactoring code is that you have  a template to start with you. A disadvantage of refactoring code is no two analyst code the same way, so you have to try to figure out their thought pattern.

The advantage of refactoring the "VB" script was that I only had to figure out the "for loops" all of the formatting for the worksheet existed. However, a disadvantage was when new code was inserted it resulted in numerous code breaks. This resulted in a more research then if an analyst just codes from scratch.
